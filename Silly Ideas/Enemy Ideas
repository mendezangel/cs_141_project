This is just if you had a quick idea draft and you wanted to put it down somewhere

Gargoyle - Every other turn he does double damage. the gimmick being if you can figure it out then you can save a ton of HP. 

dude where every ~3 attacks does a mega attack that has a warning

Was thinking of a dude who could parry, like it says they brace/ enter a form but we would need an extra action that isn't attacking or blocking so the player could capitalize on the free oppurtunity. But maybe not idk. Maybe just not getting hit for a lot is a reward in itself.
