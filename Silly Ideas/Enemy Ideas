This is just if you had a quick idea draft and you wanted to put it down somewhere

Gargoyle - Every other turn he does double damage. the gimmick being if you can figure it out then you can save a ton of HP. 

dude where every ~3 attacks does a mega attack that has a warning

Was thinking of a dude who could parry, like it says they brace/ enter a form but we would need an extra action that isn't attacking or blocking so the player could capitalize on the free oppurtunity. But maybe not idk. Maybe just not getting hit for a lot is a reward in itself.

NOTE Rainger: I'm happy to save any enemy that has a gimmick for like... Garunteed Encounters. IE: "A shuffling sound in a nearby shop catches your attention. A woman trawls herself through the entree, and as the light reveals
more you come to realise not is all right. Her toes drag roughly through glass and pavement. She stares intently at you with a brick in one hand, before beginning her violent onslaught." In this case the entirety of the 
encounter is narrative dialogue and a fight. NO userinput for decision making and such. 

I think in the case of like "Go left or right" (left=fight, right=safety) We should keep the enemy fairly simple. We also don't want this game to take too long to play yk?
